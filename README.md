## Overview
We are working towards making a BusMall app (like SkyMall, but on the bus). First we want to make an app for focus group members to give us some market research data. This data will help the marketing research team determine what products should be included in the eventual BusMall store/catalog. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This website should use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
